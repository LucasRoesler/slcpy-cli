# CLIs for Fun and Profit with Python

This repo contains some small examples of building commandline interfaces
using python.

## Who
My name is [Lucas Roesler](http://lucasroesler.com)!

## What
Python, being the wonderful batteries included language
that it is, bundles `argparse` in the standard library. Beyond `argparse`
we also discuss `click` and `hug`.

## Why
Geeky fodder for the [SLCPython meetup group](http://slcpy.com/).

## Where
At the [Zaniac Sugarhouse campus](https://www.zaniaclearning.com/)

## How
This project uses python 3.  To run the scripts you need to install `hug` and `click`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Most of the commands can be run as normal python scripts and contain help
text.
